1 Listening Socket:
 -create a socket()
 -at program start bind() a port, if it fails print an error.
 -listen() for requests from clients on that port.
 -accept() a request
 -call function to handle http request
 -continue listening/accepting

2 Server Connection:
 -create a socket()
 -bind() a port to connect to the server
 -connect() with the server
 -send http request
 -call function to write log entry
 -return the page to client

3 Client Connection:
 -create a socket
 -bind() a port
 -connect() to the client
 -forward the reply to client


// Whoever has extra time
4 Log Entry:
 -Format the entry
 -Write it to file

A QUEUE MAY NOT BE NECESSARY SINCE listen()/accept() already implements a queue
Queue:
 -Request queue--implemented as singly-linked list.
 -Add new requests to back of queue, remove from font.
 -Must store client IP and requested web address
